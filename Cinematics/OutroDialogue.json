	"You watch as RIVAL MAN's ship explodes, your once-dreaded foe departing in a blaze of glory. You feel content, for a moment, knowing you've completed your goal.",
	"But what was your goal? To race across the galaxy, destroying anything that stood in your way. Your ship growing with all of the destruction left in its wake.",
	"Almost in spite of yourself, you ponder your victory. Ponder what it cost. The poor asteroids who will never have a home, your friend dead by your own hands. All for the sake of a productivity report.",
	"You didn't ask for this.",
	"You didn't ask to be in this situation.",
	"It was the damn Laundry Corporation!",
	"A smile creeps across your face as you come to the realization, you don't need to destroy the galaxy just to move some paperweights from one bloody deathmatch to the next, forever.",
	"You are a changed captain, bound no more by the petty rules and byzantine nonsense which once plagued your life. You decide, in this moment, to dedicate yourself to making sure such absurdities never befall another captain for as long as you live.",
	"Unfortunately, in the midst of these revelations and new vistas of truth you've arrived at, you didn't notice the backup report courier slipping past your ship.",
	"You see a new message notification on your control panel and open it.",
	"Dear [captain's-name-here], you have been found to be in breach of contract and have been terminated from the Laundry Corporation, effective immediately. Please return all Laundry Corporation property in your possession before they self destruct in 10 seconds. Thank you for choosing the Laundry Corporation for your involuntary employment needs, have a great day."
